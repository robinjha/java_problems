/**
 * Question 2 / 2 (Sum-Zero)
 * Given a sequence of k integers (1 <= k <= 100000), each with a value between 0 and 10000, we want to find the longest contiguous subarray (in other words, a sub-sequence of consecutive elements) that sums to 0, and return its length. For instance:

"3 0 3" should return 1, because the 0 in the middle is a 1-element subarray that sums to 0.

"3 4 3" should return -1, because there is no sub-range of the array that sums to 0.

"1 5 4 -10" should return 4, because the entire array sums to 0.

The integers in the input will be separated by spaces, as shown above. Your solution should be as efficient as possible.
